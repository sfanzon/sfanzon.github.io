On 11th February, I will be taking part in the <b>Annual Research Sandpit Event</b> hosted by the *School of Digital and Physical Sciences* at the *University of Hull*. This is a fantastic opportunity to meet new colleagues and discuss research interests. My slides are available <a href="/assets/pdf/seminars/slides/2026/2026-Hull-Research-Event-Slides.pdf">here</a>.

@misc{2024-Fowler,
	abstract = {In this Thesis we discuss the formation, foundation and application of Optimal Transport. We explore the motivation for the founding of the field and how it evolves into a widely applicable area of mathematics.

To consolidate the content of this thesis we explore an example of the primal use of Optimal Transport - logistics. In this example we consider Royal Air Force Lossiemouth. In our problem we must find the cheapest was of supplying the base with enough aviation fuel in order to maintain it's operational capabilities as a base. We have three transport methods available to us and four other Royal Air force bases to supply the required fuel. This is done by setting up a Partial Optimal Transport problem and using Python code to find a solution numerically.

Our findings suggest that all fuel from the selected Royal Air Force stations to RAF Lossiemouth should be moved via Tanker Truck, which coincides with the cheaper option.},

@misc{2024-Hodges,
	abstract = {This dissertation explores the enduring nature of mathematics following the revelation of Godel's first Incompleteness Theorem. It provides the building blocks required to construct a formal proof of the theorem, complete with examples of key concepts along the way. The inherent difference between truth and provability is carefully considered; both mathematically and philosophically. Following the proof, a discussion into life after Godel's publication is carried out. The rebuttal of Wittgenstein; as well as the work of other philosophers was considered. This dissertation mirrors Camus' approach to the absurd by considering the notion of mathematical suicide: a metaphor for the existential crisis following the collapse of Hilbert's formalist dream. The development of computational theory from incompleteness is investigated through the Halting Problem, before considering the current P vs NP problem. Then, by examining the nature of uncertainty in quantum mechanics, and the Axiom of Choice and Continuum Hypothesis alongside Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, this dissertation proposes a new visualisation for the structure of a mathematical universe. Finally, the title question is answered by arguing that incompleteness is not a failure of mathematics, it is a feature. Whilst its discovery means that consideration must be made when forming systems, it resonates with the human existential dialogue with the uncertain, making mathematics more alive than ever. },

@misc{2024-Varley,
	abstract = {In this thesis I will look at geodesics and how the shortest path between 2 points is influenced by the surface it is on. I find the geodesics on a helicoid as well as more generally for surfaces of revolution. Then I will finish the project by looking at these problems in the context of the more abstract riemannian geometry.},

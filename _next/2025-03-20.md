I have just completed writing my teaching philosophy statement! It was a thoughtful process reflecting on my approach, values, and goals as an educator. I am sharing it now - check it out <a href="https://www.silviofanzon.com/assets/pdf/news/2025/Fanzon_Teaching_Philosophy.pdf">here</a>. Looking forward to continuing to grow as a teacher!

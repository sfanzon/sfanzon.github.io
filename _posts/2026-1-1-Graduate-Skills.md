## General Information

Welcome to the module **Graduate Skills 772213** for the MSc in Mathematics at the University of Hull, academic year 2025/26. In this course you will be assigned your MSc project and develop skills to help with it in T3.

You will

- Give short (5-10 min) Journal club presentations on at least two of the papers read.
- Write a report on a mathematical, statistical or numerical technique.
- Reflect on the presentations of others

This course is taught by a combination on-campus sessions and learning material and activities organised within Canvas. 


- **Lecturer**: Dr Silvio Fanzon

## Questions


If you have any questions please feel free to `email me` and please do not hesitate to attend `office hours`.




## Key Links


All the module information will be posted on this page. Teaching materials are posted on [Canvas](https://canvas.hull.ac.uk/courses/77826). 



## Lectures Calendar


We have two `Lectures` and one `Tutorial` per week:


- **Lecture 1**: Monday 10:00-12:00 in Wilberforce Building - Lecture Room 11
- **Lecture 2**: Tuesday 10:00-12:00 in Wilberforce Building - Lecture Room 11
- **Tutorial**: Friday 10:00-11:00 in Wilberforce Building - Lecture Room 11



## Assessment

This module will be assessed as follows:

|**Type of Assessment**            | **Percentage of final grade** |
|: -----                           |: -----                        |
|  Oral Presentations              | 70%                           |
|  Written Report                  | 25%                           |
|  Reflections on Presentations    | 5%                            |



1. **Oral Presentations** prepared and held by students:
    - I will help with the preparation of the presentations in the early stages of the module
    - The seminar atmosphere allows conceptual issues to be discussed and explored in depth in a supportive group setting
    - The order of presentations will be assigned randomly, with later presentations occurring in reverse order
    - All students will be offered an opportunity to give short practice presentations with feedback before marked presentations
    - Accommodation will be made for any student with special needs
 

2. **Written Report**:
    - The written report will require to further investigate a mathematical, statistical, or numerical technique
    - A report has to be produced on the details of the method, investigating how and why the method works
    - The report length is 2 pages (excluding references) and has to be written using latex
    - I recommend choosing a topic related to your MSc Project, but this is not necessary


3. **Reflection** on peer presentations:
    - This will be marked with a binary grading system
    - This outlines that the principle aim of the reflective process is to improve one's own skills


Deadlines and submission are on [Canvas](https://canvas.hull.ac.uk/courses/77826)

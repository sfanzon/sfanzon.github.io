<h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.3rem"><b>Welcome to my website!</b></h3>

<div markdown="1">
I am a *Lecturer in Applied Mathematics* at the [University of Hull](https://www.hull.ac.uk), UK, with *research* and *teaching* responsibilities.
</div>

<div markdown="1" style="margin-top: 1.0rem;">
My research lies at the interface of *Statistics*, *Optimization*, *PDEs*, and *Variational Methods*. 
I am interested in both the theoretical foundations of these areas and their applications
to *Mathematical Imaging*, *Materials Science*, *Sports Analytics*, and *Machine Learning*. 
Learn more in [Publications](https://www.silviofanzon.com/publications/).
</div>


<div markdown="1" style="margin-top: 1.0rem;">
I am *Fellow of the Higher Education Academy* and have taught courses across pure and applied mathematics. 
Details and materials are available on the [Teaching](https://www.silviofanzon.com/teaching/) page.
I have also supervised undergraduate and postgraduate students — learn more on the [Supervisions](https://www.silviofanzon.com/supervisions/) page.
